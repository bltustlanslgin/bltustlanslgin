Most of the papers used a wide range of indirect metrics to assess consumer welfare and essentially tried to determine whether consumers are better off with high-cost, single-payment loans with APRs usually above 300%, or with no loans at all.

But the developments of the past decade have largely made that question moot.

Now we know definitively that it’s possible for consumers to have access to small-dollar loans with smaller payments than what payday loan providers were offering, and at much lower prices—both from nonbank lenders and from banks. The two scenarios posited in much of the early research—that you could either have single-payment loans with APRs above 300% or you could have minimal access to credit—have turned out not to be the only possible options.
